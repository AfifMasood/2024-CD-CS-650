# SwiftEx Courier Management System

## Project Overview
SwiftEx Courier Management System is a console-based C++ project that simulates
real-world courier operations using core Data Structures and Algorithms.

The system handles parcel registration, sorting, routing, rider assignment,
delivery tracking, and road management.

---

## Data Structures Used
- Linked List (Parcel History, Queues)
- Queue (Pickup, Warehouse, Transit)
- Stack (Undo Operations)
- Min Heap (Priority-Based Sorting)
- Graph (Routing & Shortest Path)
- Hash Table (Parcel Tracking)

---

## Features
- Register parcels with priority and weight
- Automatic weight categorization & zone assignment
- Priority-based sorting using Min Heap
- Rider assignment with capacity constraints
- Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Road block and alternative route handling
- Undo last operation
- Parcel tracking with complete history
- Missing parcel reporting

---

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any C++ compiler (Dev-C++, CodeBlocks, VS Code)
2. Compile and run `main.cpp`
3. Use menu-driven options to operate the system

---

## Technologies
- Language: C++
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming
- Platform: Console Application
